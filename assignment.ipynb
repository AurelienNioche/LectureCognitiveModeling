    "### Goal \n",
    "\n",
    "Try out a new model and conduct a (very) small user-study in order to have an insight about what is the best model to explain human behavior in the context of a dual bandit task. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",

    "02/12/2019 - 11.59 pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "* ZIP file containing a Jupyter Notebook and (if appicable) dependencies.\n",
    "* PDF document that is the printed version of your Notebook. \n",

    "## 1. Class evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Please complete the evaluation for the class at: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdilXC3Hg1eBjzm0T8jHBxBydjJdZUnIJ3p991L8OHXRi0W-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link\n",

    "## 2. Implement a new model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rescorla-Wagner with side bias\n",
    "\n",
    "This new model assume that the subject learn by reinforcement, but has also a preference more for one side than the other (for instance, the subject prefer the rightmost option because he is righthanded).\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's define the probability of choosing option $i$ such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p_{choice}(i) = \\dfrac{\\exp (\\beta_q Q(i) + \\beta_b B(i))}{\\sum_{j \\in N} \\exp (\\beta_q Q(j) + \\beta_b B(j))} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\beta_q \\in [0,\\infty]$, $\\beta_b \\in [-\\infty, \\infty]$, and $B(i) \\in [0, N]$ the distance of option $i$ to the middle. More precisely: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "B(i) = x_i - \\dfrac{N-1}{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $x_i = 0$, if $i$ is the leftmost option, $x_i = 1$ if $i$ is the second leftmost option, ..., $x_i = (N-1)$ if $i$ is the rightmost option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\beta_b$ is defined over $[-\\infty, \\infty]$ to allow both left-bias and right bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Updating rule** ($\\alpha$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The updating rule for the q-values is unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q^{t+1}(i) = Q^t(i) + \\alpha(s - Q^t(i))\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "with $s = 1$ if success, $0$ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you can inherit from the RW class that is defined in the lecture's Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Complete the a priori analysis of the new model\n",
    "\n",
    "Go towards Section 2 to 5 of the class, but instead of taking as object the Rescola-Wagner's model, consider the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conduct a mini-study\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct a mini-study with 4 participants. Conduct the analysis described in the Section 5 with your own data. Does the new model provides a better explanation of your data, compared to a 'pure' Rescola-Wagner model? Justify. "
